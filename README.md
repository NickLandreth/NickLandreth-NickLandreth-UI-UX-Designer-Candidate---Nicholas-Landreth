Hi, I am Nicholas Landreth. This is my test project of the pizza management system I was instructed to complete to for the interview process. I have attached a zip folder containing the HTML, CSS and images folder for my static HTML mockup. I have also attached a word doc that has links to my Figma and Figjam files that have my design files and documentation of the project, but I will also be including the links in this readme file. Thank you for your time and condideration, I hope to hear from your team soon.
